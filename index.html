        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a college freshman that is currently studying at University of California - Riverside. At this point, I am mainly focusing on the Psychology major. During the first quarter, I got into the class ‚ÄúPsyc 002‚Äù, which is a class that briefly introduces the basics of psychology from all different aspects. While learning in this class, I found the field of psychology that I am more interested in. I like to learn about stress and how people can solve the problems that were led out by stress. This also relates to the career that I want to work in the future, which is being a mental counselor.<br><br>

        Furthermore, I believe that knowing more languages is also helpful for me to become a mental counselor. At this point, I already know how to speak Mandarin, Cantonese, and English, but I think these are not enough. Therefore, I am planning to get into the Italian Studies minor next year. However, before I get into the Italian language class in school, I decided to learn some basic grammar of Italian on my own. I am hoping that if I know more languages then in the future my patients can more easily tell me what is making them suffer and I can provide a more helpful way for them to solve their problems.<br><br>
